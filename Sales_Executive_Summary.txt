 Executive Summary – Sales Performance & Customer Insights Dashboard
Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard designed to analyze revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency across multiple dimensions such as time, occasions, categories, products, cities, and delivery timelines.
The dashboard enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by quickly identifying high-performing segments, seasonal trends, and potential areas for improvement.

 Key Financial Highlights

Total Revenue: ₹35.21 Lakhs

Average Revenue per Customer: ₹3,520.98

Average Order-to-Delivery Time: 5.53 days

These metrics indicate a strong revenue base with consistent customer spending and a reasonably efficient delivery cycle, which is crucial for customer satisfaction in time-sensitive purchases.

 Revenue Trends & Seasonality

Revenue peaks are observed in February and August, indicating strong seasonal or promotional demand.

Lower revenue periods appear around April–June and September, suggesting opportunities for targeted campaigns or discounts.

Day-wise analysis shows:

Highest revenue on Tuesday and Sunday

Lowest performance on Wednesday and Thursday

 Business Insight: Optimizing promotions during low-performing days can help stabilize weekly revenue.

 Occasion-Based Performance

Anniversary and Raksha Bandhan are the top revenue-generating occasions.

Birthdays contribute moderate revenue.

Valentine’s Day and Diwali show comparatively lower performance.

 Business Insight:
Occasion-driven marketing has a significant impact. Underperforming occasions can benefit from better bundling, targeted ads, or personalized offers.
